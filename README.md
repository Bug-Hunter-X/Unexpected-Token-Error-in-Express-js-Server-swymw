# Unexpected Token Error in Express.js Server
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Express.js where an unexpected token error occurs during server startup.  The error isn't a typical syntax error; instead, it arises from the server encountering unexpected data in a request or response.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains a minimal Express.js server.  However, under certain conditions (e.g., a malformed request from a client or an issue with middleware), it may throw an `Unexpected token` error.  This is difficult to debug because it doesn't point to a clear syntax issue in the server code itself.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to mitigate this.  It focuses on robust error handling and input validation to prevent the error from occurring.

The solution includes:

*   **Middleware for parsing JSON:** Ensure that the server correctly parses JSON requests and handles potential errors gracefully.
*   **Error handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks to catch unexpected errors during request processing.
*   **Input sanitization:** Validate and sanitize any input from the client to prevent the server from encountering malformed data.
*   **Logging:** Use detailed logging to help diagnose the issue.

This approach helps pinpoint the source of unexpected tokens, allowing for better debugging and more resilient server behavior.
